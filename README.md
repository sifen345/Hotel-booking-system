This is a simple console-based Hotel Management System written in C++.
It manages bookings for 200 hotel rooms, allowing you to:

Book rooms (choose AC/Non-AC, swimming, spa).

Validate customer name, address, phone number, and dates.

View customer details or room status.

Check out and see the final bill (with discount & tax).

Save booking data to a file, so bookings persist even after restarting.
